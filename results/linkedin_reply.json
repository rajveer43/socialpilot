  "post_text": "Say Hello to A2A: The Future of AI Agent Collaboration\r\n\r\nGoogle just introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, and it\u2019s a big leap forward in how AI agents interact and work together.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re familiar with MCP (Model Context Protocol), you know it allowed apps to send structured context to LLMs \u2014 kind of like plugging your app directly into an AI brain.\r\n\r\nA2A takes it further. It enables AI agents themselves to communicate, coordinate, and collaborate across different systems using a shared, open protocol.\r\nWhat\u2019s even more exciting? Over 50 companies, including big names like Google , Cohere ,SAP,Cognizant,Capgemini ,Infosys, Replit ,LangChain ,Atlassian and more, have come together to support and contribute to this open standard.\r\n\r\nA2A means:\r\nAgents speak the same language using structured message formats (roles, content types, IDs)\r\n\r\nCross-platform compatibility for multi-agent workflows\r\n\r\nReal interoperability across AI ecosystems\r\n\r\nCheck out this:\r\nhttps://lnkd.in/grzUzNeC\r\n\r\nhashtag#A2A hashtag#AIagents hashtag#Interoperability hashtag#MCP hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#MultiAgentSystems hashtag#OpenStandards hashtag#GoogleAI hashtag#OpenAI hashtag#SAP hashtag#Google",
